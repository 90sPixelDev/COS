# COS

With this program you can create, edit, delete lists of "Characters" with added basic info to them as well as have multiple lists of them with an included save and load option. 

This program is a simple CRUD program made entirely in C# in Visual Studio 2019. It was a test project to further my understanding of the C# language.

The save and load option was created with the binary formatter back a few years ago, which as we know now is a security risk and not to be used anymore.
